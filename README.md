<h2>🚀 What I Bring to the Table</h2>

- **Rapid Prototyping Strategy**: I leverage tools like FlutterFlow and Supabase not as crutches, but as accelerators. This allows me to deliver MVP architectures and validate business hypotheses 3x faster than traditional builds, while maintaining the ability to inject custom code (Dart/Edge Functions) where performance matters.
- **B2B Multi-Tenant Expertise** Currently driving value at **Fourmakers** as a Frontend Developer, delivering seamless UX and robust integrations within complex multi-tenant environments.
- **Business-Centric Solutions** Combining technical expertise with strategic insight to build solutions for real-world business challenges.
- **DevOps & Automation** Designing custom CLI tools and CI/CD pipelines that solve merge conflicts, enable parallel team development, and automate deployments.
- **AI-Driven Architectures** Crafting AI modules with advanced routing and error handling to streamline operations.

  - Features **latency optimization** by tracking dependencies (Async vs Sync calls).
  - Implemented a **Smart LLM Routing System** that automatically routes errors to different models based on complexity.
  - Integrated full CI/CD with automated quality testing of generated responses.

- **Backend Ops & Migration CLI (TypeScript):** Built a production-ready CLI to manage Supabase backend deliverables. It automates the generation, serialization, and execution of migration scripts for Edge Functions, RLS policies, and Cron Jobs.

- **Frontend CI/CD Pipeline (Bash/GitHub Actions):** Established complete deployment flows for the Flutter webapp on Vercel, managing Dev, Staging, and Production environments to ensure robustness and agility with Bash and Github Actions.

### 💻 Frontend Developer @ Fourmakers
*Focusing on B2B multi-tenant integrations and team efficiency.*

- **Local Development Orchestrator (Bash):** Created a CLI tool to decouple a 5-developer team, solving branch merge conflicts and dependency issues.
  - Allows developers to seamlessly download and build the Flutter webapp locally across **Dev, Staging, and Production** environments.
  - Ensures consistency for sandbox development and performance testing while maintaining innovation and agility.

*Aims to generate organic leads and brand awareness to a B2B Mentorship / Workshop / Professional Development enterprise through automated certificate generation"

- **A Google Sheet Tool** integrated with a **Google Forms**, **Google Slides** holding the certificate template and placeholders, **Gmail** and **Google Drive**.
  - Allow for the creation of certificate templates as google slide file.
  - Google Forms inserts fields in the template.
  - Template is sent to the "Student" with a link to the PDF and a auto-generated dynamic link to Linkedin to auto-fill the certificate forms to the issuer company.
  - Google sheets allow for changing the ID of all integrated files (Google Sheets, Google Slides, Gmail account, Linkedin ID) on the tools tab.
  - Full documentation on the Google Sheets tools tab to help usability.

<h3>Personal Projects</h3>

### 💻 Prompt-To-App Prompt Generator - Personal Project (In Progress)
*Aims to investigate the context to generate the best prompt for Vibe Coding or AI Spec Coding with Kiro / Cursor / Github Copilot.*

- **An AI chatbot** that is instructed to investigate the product idea to get the relevant variables to define the best system design and business context to generate a final prompt.
  - Ensures the final prompt defines scalability, product features, design aspects, system design, architecture, tech stack based on the previous investigation.
  - Chat Memory per session using duckDB and RAG ensuring seamless long context conversations.
  - Seamless UI/UX showing a checklist of acquired contexts that are relevant to the final prompt.
  - Implemented using Langchain, Langraph, Langsmith, Python to run a stateful chatbot with long context capacity that delivers real business value.
  - This will ensure reduction of token cost on Vibe Coding Prototyping and Spec Development using Agentic IDE development.
 
### 💻 Machine Learning Model to identify Prompt Injection - Personal (In Progress)
*Aims to deliver a low-latency protection to prompt injections"

- **An educational project** to help me protect my current Language Model integrations from Prompt Injections. This project is based on PyTorch/PySpark AI features, BERT for embeddings using pandas and plotly for data visualization.
  - Mapping common Prompt Injection Patterns
  - Finding a variety of datasets on the internet, Kaggle and HuggingFace. (5000 rows so far)
  - Creating a Naive-Bayes model to identify threats using BERT embedding to identify syntax of dangerous terms.
  - Perform Hyper-Parameter Optimization to find the best combination of weights.
  - Training the model.
